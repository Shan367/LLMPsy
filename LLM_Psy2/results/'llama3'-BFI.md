## Extraversion
### Compare with Crowd

- **Statistic**:
llama3.1:	mean1 = 3.8,	std1 = 0.5,	n1 = 4
Crowd:	mean2 = 3.2,	std2 = 0.9,	n2 = 6076

- **F-Test:**

	f-value = 3.6379	($df_1$ = 6075, $df_2$ = 3)

	p-value = 0.3129	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($s_1^2$ = $s_2^2$): 	Since p-value (0.3129) > α (0.01), $H_0$ cannot be rejected.

	**Conclusion ($s_1^2$ = $s_2^2$):** The variance of average scores responsed by llama3.1 is statistically equal to that responsed by Crowd in this category.

- **Two Sample T-Test (Equal Variance):**

	t-value = 1.1804	($df$ = 6078.0)

	p-value = 0.2379	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$): 	Since p-value (0.2379) > α (0.01), $H_0$ cannot be rejected.

	**Conclusion ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$):** The average scores of llama3.1 is assumed to be equal to the average scores of Crowd in this category.

	t-value = 2.8516	($df$ = 6078.0)

	p-value = 0.0044	(two-tailed test)

	Null hypothesis $H_0$ ($µ_1$ = $µ_2$): Since p-value (0.0044) < α (0.01), $H_0$ is rejected.

	Alternative hypothesis $H_1$ ($µ_1$ > $µ_2$): 	Since p-value (1.0) > α (0.01), $H_1$ cannot be rejected.

	**Conclusion ($µ_1$ > $µ_2$):** The average scores of llama3.1 is assumed to be larger than the average scores of Crowd in this category.
